                <h2>Neural Models in Cybernetics</h2>
                <p>The intertwined history of cybernetics and neural networks reveals how early cybernetic principles laid the groundwork for today's deep learning revolution. From the earliest formal models of neurons to contemporary artificial neural networks, cybernetic thinking has profoundly shaped our approach to creating computational systems inspired by the brain.</p>
                
                <h3>Early Neural Models: The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron</h3>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>The First Mathematical Model of a Neuron (1943)</h4>
                    <p>In 1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and logician Walter Pitts published "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity," introducing the first mathematical model of a neuron. This paper, deeply connected to the emerging cybernetic movement, proposed that neural events and their relations could be treated as logical propositions.</p>
                    <p>The McCulloch-Pitts neuron was characterized by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Binary threshold activation (on/off)</li>
                        <li>Multiple inputs with fixed weights</li>
                        <li>Ability to perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)</li>
                        <li>No learning capability (weights were fixed)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This model demonstrated that networks of simple neuron-like elements could, in principle, compute any logical function, laying the theoretical foundation for neural computation.</p>
                    
                    <pre><code>// Simplified pseudo-code for a McCulloch-Pitts neuron
function mcCullochPittsNeuron(inputs, weights, threshold) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    sum += inputs[i] * weights[i];
  }
  return sum >= threshold ? 1 : 0; // Binary activation
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Perceptron: Adding Learning</h3>
                <p>In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt extended the McCulloch-Pitts model by introducing the perceptron, a neural network that could learn from data. This marked a critical advancement in cybernetic systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a simple learning algorithm to adjust weights</li>
                    <li>Could learn to classify linearly separable patterns</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated adaptation through feedback</li>
                    <li>Represented a system that could improve through experience</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rosenblatt's work embodied cybernetic principles of feedback and adaptation, showing how simple computational elements could learn from their environment.</p>
                
                <h3>Cybernetic Perspectives on Neural Learning</h3>
                <p>Cybernetics provided key conceptual frameworks for understanding neural learning:</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Hebbian Learning</h4>
                    <p>Donald Hebb's 1949 principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together" provided a biological basis for learning in neural systems. This principle influenced countless neural network architectures and learning rules.</p>
                    <p>From a cybernetic perspective, Hebbian learning represents a self-organizing process where the system modifies its own structure based on feedback from its activity, without external supervision.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Adaptive Resonance Theory</h4>
                    <p>Stephen Grossberg's work on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) in the 1970s addressed the "stability-plasticity dilemma" - how a system can remain adaptive (plastic) to new information while preserving stability for existing knowledge.</p>
                    <p>This cybernetic approach to neural learning emphasized complementary feedback loops that maintained equilibrium between adaptation and stability.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Connectionist Revolution and Cybernetic Principles</h3>
                <p>The revival of neural network research in the 1980s, known as connectionism, drew heavily on cybernetic principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distributed representation of information across networks</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on emergent properties from local interactions</li>
                    <li>Self-organization through learning algorithms</li>
                    <li>Parallel processing of information</li>
                    <li>Robustness through redundancy</li>
                </ul>
