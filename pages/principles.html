                <h2>Core Principles of Cybernetics</h2>
                <p>Cybernetics, at its essence, is concerned with understanding how systems regulate themselves, evolve, and communicate. The field combines insights from control theory, information theory, biology, and cognitive science to develop a unified approach to systems that process information and adapt to their environments.</p>
                
                <h3>Feedback Loops</h3>
                <p>The concept of feedback is fundamental to cybernetics. Feedback loops allow systems to adjust their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Negative Feedback</h4>
                    <p>In negative feedback systems, deviations from a desired state trigger corrective actions that bring the system back toward that state. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining stability and homeostasis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A thermostat that turns on heating when temperature drops below a set point and turns it off when temperature exceeds the set point.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Positive Feedback</h4>
                    <p>Positive feedback amplifies deviations, potentially leading to rapid change, growth, or collapse. While often destabilizing, positive feedback can be essential for learning, evolution, and phase transitions in systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Population growth where more individuals lead to more reproduction, further increasing the population size.</p>

                <h3>Homeostasis</h3>
                <p>Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to maintain internal stability and equilibrium through regulatory mechanisms. This concept, borrowed from biology, is central to understanding how complex systems persist despite environmental changes.</p>
                <p>Cybernetic systems use feedback loops to achieve homeostasis by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Detecting deviations from optimal states</li>
                    <li>Initiating corrective actions</li>
                    <li>Monitoring the effects of those actions</li>
                    <li>Adjusting responses as needed</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Variety and the Law of Requisite Variety</h3>
                <p>W. Ross Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety states that "only variety can absorb variety." This means that for a system to be effective at regulating another system, it must have at least as much variety (possible states) as the system it's regulating.</p>
                <p>This principle has profound implications for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control systems design</li>
                    <li>Organizational management</li>
                    <li>AI and adaptive systems</li>
                    <li>Biological evolution</li>
                </ul>
                
                <pre><code>// Simplified pseudo-code for a homeostatic system
function regulateSystem(current, target, tolerance) {
  while (Math.abs(current - target) > tolerance) {
    if (current < target) {
      // Increase variable
      current += computeAdjustment(target - current);
    } else {
      // Decrease variable
      current -= computeAdjustment(current - target);
    }
    // Monitor and reassess
    current = measureCurrentState();
  }
  return current;
}</code></pre>
                
                <h3>Self-Organization</h3>
                <p>Cybernetics explores how order emerges spontaneously in complex systems through local interactions without centralized control. Self-organization challenges traditional top-down views of system design and control.</p>
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emergence of global patterns from local interactions</li>
                    <li>Adaptation to environmental changes</li>
                    <li>Resilience through distributed control</li>
                    <li>Information processing at multiple levels</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Circularity and Recursion</h3>
                <p>Cybernetic systems often exhibit circular causality, where effects feed back to become causes. This recursive nature creates complex dynamics that challenge linear thinking and conventional notions of cause and effect.</p>
                <p>This principle is evident in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neural networks and brain function</li>
                    <li>Ecosystems and food webs</li>
                    <li>Social systems and institutions</li>
                    <li>Algorithmic recursion in computation</li>
                </ul>
